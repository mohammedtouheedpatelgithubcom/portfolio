# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository — a central place for my cybersecurity journey, technical growth, and hands-on work across courses, labs, events, internships, and competitions.

This repo is designed to show:
- What I’ve learned
- What I’ve built
- How I solve practical security problems

## About This Repository

This portfolio collects my academic and practical cybersecurity work in one organized space. It includes:

- Certifications and course progress
- Internship and hackathon experience
- Security project work
- Event participation and extracurricular activity
- Practice resources and challenge walkthrough material

If you are a recruiter, collaborator, mentor, or fellow learner, this repository gives a quick and transparent view of my consistency and skills.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `coursera/` | Learning materials, notes, and outcomes from Coursera programs |
| `edx/` | Coursework and certification-related resources from edX |
| `nptel/` | NPTEL learning artifacts and progress documents |
| `internship/` | Internship experiences, reports, and practical security work |
| `hackathon/` | Hackathon participation, ideas, and project records |
| `events/` | Conferences, workshops, and cybersecurity event involvement |
| `extra-curricular/` | Technical and leadership activities outside core coursework |
| `topicInCyberProject/` | Focused project work (e.g., malicious domain detection notebook) |
| `videos/CTFLearn/` | CTF learning and challenge-related video resources |
| `extra/` | Supporting materials and additional evidence of work |

## Featured Work Snapshot

### Detecting Malicious Domains
- Notebook-based exploration in `topicInCyberProject/Detecting_Malicious_Domain.ipynb`
- Demonstrates practical analysis mindset for threat detection use cases

### CTF + Security Practice
- Learning artifacts in `videos/CTFLearn/`
- Focus on offensive and defensive problem-solving workflows

### Professional Development Trail
- Continuous progress through structured platforms (`Coursera`, `edX`, `NPTEL`)
- Combined with hands-on exposure through `internship/`, `events/`, and `hackathon/`

## Why This Portfolio Stands Out

- **Consistency:** Ongoing documentation of growth across multiple learning paths
- **Practical Focus:** Real-world oriented cybersecurity projects and exercises
- **Breadth + Depth:** Mix of academics, projects, competitions, and field experience
- **Organized Evidence:** Easy-to-navigate structure for fast review

## How to Use This Repo

1. Start with the folder table above to choose the area you care about.
2. Open project/course folders to review outputs and supporting artifacts.
3. Check `topicInCyberProject/` for technical project depth.
4. Explore `internship/`, `hackathon/`, and `events/` for practical exposure.

## Goals

This repository will continue to evolve with:
- New security projects
- More CTF and SOC-style practice
- Stronger documentation and reproducibility
- Better demonstration of impact and outcomes
